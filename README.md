# **Memory Allocation and CPU Scheduling Simulator**

This project is a simple interactive website designed to help users understand and calculate **memory allocation** and **CPU scheduling algorithms**. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and educational experience.

---

## **Features**
- **Memory Allocation**:
  - First-Fit
  - Best-Fit
  - Worst-Fit
- **CPU Scheduling**:
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling
- Interactive input forms for processes and memory blocks.
- Dynamic visualizations to illustrate scheduling and memory allocation.
- Real-time calculation of:
  - CPU execution order
  - Turnaround time
  - Waiting time
  - Memory block utilization
- User-friendly interface for better learning and understanding.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing interactive features and calculations.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dikshit-Sharma/CPU-Scheduling-Memory-Allocation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPU-Scheduling-Memory-Allocation
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the application.

4. You can split the code and images into different folders src and public to make navigation easy just change the paths afterwards accordingly.
